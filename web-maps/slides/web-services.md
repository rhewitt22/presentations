##  Web Services

When you have lots of data you can make it available as a service, and have the map request only what it needs.

 - Display data differently at different zoom levels
 - Better for polygon data with lots of vertices
 - Requires a server
 - Often refered to as an 'Overlay'
 - [Well defined standards](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/is)
